# Background and Motivation

Motor vehicle crashes are unfortunately quite prevalent in the state of California. We were interested in determining whether or not there was a seasonality effect on car crashes based on differing periods of time (time of day, day of month, and month of year). If seasonality patterns emerged, such information could be used to inform policy-decisions (i.e., if nighttime crashes were more common, increasing nighttime driver safety on highways could be one such intervention). 

We utilized various statistical methods, including a Chi-Square test and Kruskal-Wallis test, to make our determinations. 

# Installation

Run `make env` in your terminal/shell to set up the conda environment.

Then use resulting `traffic-collisions` kernel to run all analysis notebooks.
